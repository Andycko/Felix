# Felix - The wireless security guy

Felix is a native application for Android developed in React Native using Expo SDK. The app has a narrator called Felix who is a major's degree student of networking. Felix has diced that as the contemporary world we live in is full of wireless networks, that people should learn at least the very basics of their operation. That, of course, includes the basic technical vocabulary in the field as well as a brief description of the most used security and encryption protocols.

## Software

As mentioned, Felix is developed in JavaScript using React Native framework and Expo SDK. The app is built for Android, however, the code is 95% functional for iOS as well.

### Prerequisites

For developing this project, the Expo CLI and Node JS are required. Yarn could be also used as a great alternative for NPM, as NPM has the tendency to crash and does not really get along with Expo.
